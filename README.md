# Lilla_Nian_game
This is a word guessing game (Little Nine in English). All you have to do is quess as many words as you can from the grid of 9 letters. 
Every letter in the nine grid can only be used once and the letter in the middle must be in all words. 

#### Some other rules: 
- words have to be in basic form (no plural, no past tense)
- words have to be between 4-9 letters long (there is only one 9-letter word)
- to win you have to guess all words 

Good luck!
